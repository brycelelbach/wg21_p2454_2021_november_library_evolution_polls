# Polls # {#poll}

Each poll consists of a statement; you vote on whether you support the
  statement.
All polls will be 5-way polls; you'll vote either "strongly favor",
  "weakly favor", "neutral", "weakly against", or "strongly against".

All committee members may vote, but if you have not participated in the
  Library Evolution discussions of a poll (in-person, over telecon, or
  over email), please consider whether you sufficiently understand the
  topic to be able to vote in an informed manner.
If you do not, please choose to not participate in the poll.

If you do not want to participate in a poll, select the "I do not want to
  participate in this poll" option.
Those who do not participate in a poll will not be counted or recorded.
Voting neutral is not the same as choosing to not participate; please
  don't vote neutral if you did not participate in the discussions of
  the poll.

Each poll has a comment field.
Please write a few sentences explaining the rationale for your vote.
We recommend drafting your comments in a text editor and then pasting them
  into the polling system.

Poll results and selected comments will be shared with Library Evolution after
  the end of the polling period, including attribution of your votes and comments.

If you want to discuss the polls or how you plan on voting, please start an
  email thread on the
  <a href="lib-ext@lists.isocpp.org">Library Evolution mailing list</a>.

You will not receive a confirmation email after voting.

If you need to see how you voted, change how you voted, or have any questions
  or issues about voting, please contact the Library Evolution chair.
